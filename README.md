# Handheld Game Console

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a **Handheld Game Console** developed as a **fully working academic embedded system**. It is designed to be simple, intuitive, and accessible, with a special focus on usability for **mentally challenged individuals**, while remaining engaging and usable for everyone.

The system uses a joystick-based input mechanism and physical buttons to navigate through on-screen interactions displayed via an I2C LCD. A working demonstration video is included with the repository to showcase real-time functionality.

## 💻 Software & Tools

* **IDE**: Keil µVision
* **Programming Language**: Embedded C
* **Communication Protocols**: ADC, I2C, EXTI

---

## ⚙️ System Overview

* The joystick provides analog input to the MCU via ADC channels
* Button presses are handled using EXTI interrupts
* The LCD communicates through the I2C protocol to display menus and system responses
* SysTick timer ensures consistent timing and responsiveness
* The entire system is optimized for simplicity and reliability

## 🎮 Games Included

The handheld console includes **two simple and accessible games** designed to encourage engagement, memory, and motor coordination. These games are intentionally minimalistic to ensure ease of use for mentally challenged individuals, while remaining enjoyable for everyone.

### 🧠 Memory Game

* Simple pattern or sequence recognition
* Joystick used for navigation and selection
* Button used for confirmation
* Calm gameplay with clear visual feedback on the LCD

### 🏃 Platform Runner

* A basic side-scrolling style game
* Joystick used for movement/navigation
* Button used for actions such as jump or select
* Simple visuals and mechanics to avoid cognitive overload
